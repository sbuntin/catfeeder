# Cat Feeder
This project is my attempt at an automated cat feeder. 

# Current Hardware:
Raspberry Pi 3
breadboard
servo (Futaba S3003)
switch and led

# Future Hardware necessary for purpose:

an actual cat feeder (cereal dispenser or homegrown PVC setup)
second servo and feed bin (some dispensers are dual bin already)
cat-triggerable button

# Future hardware for feature creep:
webcam
motion sensor

# Current capabilities

feed by pushbutton
feed by email with trigger phrase in subject or body
feed by text (uses google voice, which is forwarded to email)

# Future capabilities
feed by cat (using pushbutton - maybe headbutt a panel over a switch?)
feed treat portion instead of full portion (possibly using second servo and feeder)
motion-sensor triggers feed, camera, or both
web-cam
